# GLaMS
Gamepad Listen-and-Manipulate System for SwiCC.

Currently requires xInput-compatible controller.  Only works in Chromium-based browsers.

## Installation
Just host it somewhere.

## Use
1. Go to index.html.
2. Move the controller around to confirm that the page can access it.
3. Click the Serial Connect button and select the connection to your SwiCC device.

Should then be good to go.
